<h3>Pranav Beach Resort</h3>
<img src="pictures/034.jpg" width="800" height="300">
<p><b>Pranav Beach resort is all that they claim to be. It is unique among the many beach resorts line up the Palliyanmoola beach road. The energetic couple who owns and run it is there to take care of their guests and meet their needs. I thoroughly enjoyed my brief time spent their and wish them well. Environment friendly construction of the cottages using recycled doors and windows of the yore is an added attraction. Kerala food is on the menu mainly but will prepare whatever you request. Fresh fish is always there and they themselves shop for it early in the morning. All in all, a great place to spend a few days to enjoy sun, sand and local food.<b/></p>
