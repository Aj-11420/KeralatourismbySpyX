Environment friendly construction of the cottages using recycled doors and windows of the yore is an added attraction. Kerala food is on the menu mainly but will prepare whatever you request. Fresh fish is always there and they themselves shop for it early in the morning. All in all, a great place to spend a few days to enjoy sun, sand and local food.<b/></p>
